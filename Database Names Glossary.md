**ARTL**  Player art for a given play

**PBPL**  play object

**PLPD**  Pass data. Any plays that are pass/rpo plays have one of these linked to the play's unique PLYL ID. This controls receivers and allows you to change receivers to different icons, set which receivers will have visible icons, and also set the percentage chance that a CPU will throw to a certain receiver.

**PLRD**  Just like PLPD, but for run plays/RPOs. Only adjustable one here is the hole #, which controls how your OL blocks and how the defense reacts to the play.

**PLRR**  The type of action the player is doing (?)

**PLYS**  A table that plays read. There are 11 entries per play, one for each player. Each entry has a PSAL, ARTL, and PLRR.  This is the main thing you tinker with when adjusting plays.

**PLYT**  play type (concept?)

**PSAL**  Player action table link

**PSLO**  All those PSALs that are inputted into PLYS come from this table. Each PSAL within this table has up to 8 steps, each one is an individual movement or action from a player that creates one fluid PSAL. The codes within this table control what the action actually is per step.

**SETG**  This refers to the SETP. Here, you can adjust where players line up, allowing you to create your own formations.

**SETL**  This is just basic settings for each subformation. TBH I'm not sure what anything in this does except for POSO, which controls who receives the snap on offense. Not sure what it controls defensively.

**SETL**  formation

**SITT**  Unknown

**SITT**  game plan situation

**SRMM**  Blocking scheme for a play (?)
